# Wex

This project uses Quarkus as framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

To execute the application you must navigate to .docker folder and start the stack.yaml with the command:
```shell script
docker-compose -f stack.yml -p docker up -d
```
This compose will start all the requirements for the application be able to run.
There you will find:
1. MySQL database
2. Flyway - For versionsing the database
3. Adminer - To access database
4. Rapidoc - OpenAPI Spec viewing.
5. Nginx - Reverse proxy.
6. Prometheus - To scrap metrics on our app.
7. Grafana - To show dashboards
8. Keycloak - Provides authentication for our app.

When the compose finishes got to app folder where you will execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

## Testing endpoints
After quarkus starts, you need to get a token at:
```shell script
curl --location 'http://localhost:8081/realms/wex/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=password' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=backend' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret=FOJHmE8A3ckjM5mANHLBAE72PbFIyzED' \
--data-urlencode 'username=wex-admin' \
--data-urlencode 'password=wex-admin'
```
We have two users
1. wex-admin (password wex-admin), with admin role.
2. user (password user), with user role.

Our app only accept admin role, so if ou try to access any endpoint with user, you will receive a 403 Forbidden.

After you get your token you can open your browser and access
http://localhost:5000
It will open the Rapidoc to you test, like this image:
![Rapidoc home page](resources/readme-images/rapidoc.png?raw=true)
In the authentication section you will insert the token following the format: Bearer <token> and press update. Doing this all endpoints will automatically send the Authorization header with your token.

The endpoints we have are:
* Save a new purchase (/v1/purchases)
* Retrieve a purchase (/v1/purchases/{uuid}?country=<country_name>)
Obs: If you don't want to create a new purchase, we have some preloaded for you, just see the V9999999999999__INSERT_Purchase.sql file at /resources/flyway/db/integration-test

## Monitoring application
If you access http://localhost:5000/grafana you will access our grafana dashboards.
The user and password for access is (user: admin, password: admin). After you prompt the credentials, grafana will ask you to change the password, just pick one of your choice or maintain the same.

In grafana we have two dashboards:
1. App - Basic - That monitor JVM memory consumption, CPU usage and much more information
2. Rest client - This dashboard collect data for our Fault Tolerance annotations.

If you prefer going to prometheus just access http://localhost:5000/prometheus
![Prometheus](resources/readme-images/Prometheus.png)

## Accessing database
If you like to perform some queries in database, you can access http://localhost:5000/adminer
![adminer login screen](resources/readme-images/adminer-login.png)

Now you just need to complete the blank fields:
* Username: root
* Password: admin
* Database: wex

Now feel free to navigate through database.

## Testing tools
This application has a test coverage of 96% for line and mutation coverage.
### Jacoco
Jacoco is a tool to help us measure line coverage of our application
![jacoco report](resources/readme-images/jacoco-report.png)
### PiTest
PiTest is a tool to measure mutation coverage in our application
![pitest report](resources/readme-images/pitest-report.png)

### Testcontainers
For integration test it's using Testcontainers and RestAssured.
If you want to see all the integration tests, it's located at integration-test module.
Obs: I need to skip IT because I could not configure Keycloak container in time. It's always returning issuer invalid and if I skip issuer validation I receive an error at Keycloak container.
